My Recipes Project! 
In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website. This will be done with the foundations of HTML. The skills that will be applied to this project are using elements, tags, making a HTML Boilerplate, working with text as well as using lists, links and images. I will also be writting commit messages throughout the project.
